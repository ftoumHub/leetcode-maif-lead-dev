/**
 * Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair
 * of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front
 * of
 * this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the
 * queue.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * The number of people is less than 1,100.
 * <pre>
 * Input:
 * [[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]
 *
 * Output:
 * [[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]
