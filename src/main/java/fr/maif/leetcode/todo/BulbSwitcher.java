/**
 * There are n bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs. Then, you turn off
 * every second bulb. On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it's off or
 * turning off if it's on). For the ith round, you toggle every i bulb. For the nth round, you only
 * toggle the last bulb. Find how many bulbs are on after n rounds.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <p>
 * Given n = 3.
 * <p>
 * At first, the three bulbs are [off, off, off].
 * After first round, the three bulbs are [on, on, on].
 * After second round, the three bulbs are [on, off, on].
 * After third round, the three bulbs are [on, off, off].
 * <p>
 * So you should return 1, because there is only one bulb is on.
 * <p>
 * --> "on" or "off" at each position in an array of length n?
 * <p>
 * --> toggle even number times will result in "on", toggle odd number times will result in "off"
 * <p>
 * --> for position k, the number of toggles is the number of distinct divisors that k has
 * <p>
 * --> divisors always come in pair, which means even number of divisors, for example, 12 has
 * (1,12),(2,6),(3,4).
 * <p>
 * --> however, Square Number has odd number of divisors, e.g. 25 has 1,25,5
 * <p>
 * --> thus, the number of "on", is the number of perfect square number <= n
