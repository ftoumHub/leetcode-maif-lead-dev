/**
 * Given an Iterator class interface with methods: next() and hasNext(), design and implement a
 * PeekingIterator that support the peek() operation -- it essentially peek() at the element that
 * will be returned by the next call to next().
 * <p>
 * Here is an example. Assume that the iterator is initialized to the beginning of the list: [1, 2,
 * 3].
 * <p>
 * Call next() gets you 1, the first element in the list.
 * <p>
 * Now you call peek() and it returns 2, the next element. Calling next() after that still return
 * 2.
 * <p>
 * You call next() the final time and it returns 3, the last element. Calling hasNext() after that
 * should return false.
